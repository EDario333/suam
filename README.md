# Welcome to the SUAM Project 

SUAM stands for **S**peeding **U**p data **A**nalysis for **M**exico with artificial intelligence and distributed computing. Is a project based on previous work done and with results being evaluated by a Scientific Committee.

# The SUAM's origin

Concerned about the current situation about the SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico, a group of young, enthusiasts and very capable people decided to start this project.

# What's next?

Nowadays we are working with a new (second) paper with the first results from our experiments and we expect to release the architecture first version in these days.
